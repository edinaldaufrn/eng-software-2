## Django
Django is a powerful and popular web framework for Python. It was created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison as a way to build news websites quickly and easily. Django follows the model-view-template (MVT) pattern and provides many features such as authentication, database abstraction, URL routing, template engine, and more. Django is designed to help developers create web applications that are fast, secure, scalable, and maintainable. Django is free and open source and has a large and active community of users and contributors

## VS Code
VS Code is a free and open source code editor that supports many languages and platforms. It has integrated tools for debugging and version control, which help developers create and test their applications. VS Code allows users to launch or attach to a program in debug mode, set breakpoints, inspect variables, and more. VS Code also supports Git as the default version control system, which enables users to track changes, commit, push, pull, merge, and more. VS Code is customizable and extensible with various extensions and themes.

## Branch and Pull Request
Branches and pull requests are essential features of Git, a distributed version control system that allows developers to collaborate on code. Branches allow developers to work on different versions of the same codebase without affecting the main branch. Branches can be used for developing new features, fixing bugs, experimenting with ideas, and more. Branches can be merged back to the main branch when they are ready or deleted if they are no longer needed.

Pull requests are a way of requesting feedback or approval from other collaborators on a branch before merging it to the main branch. Pull requests also facilitate code review and discussion before merging the changes. Pull requests can be created on platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket that host Git repositories. Pull requests can also be created from the command line using Git commands. Pull requests help developers to ensure that the code is consistent, reliable, and meets the project standards

## Semantic Versioning
Semantic Versioning is a set of rules and best practices for assigning and increasing software version numbers. The objective is to facilitate the understanding and communication of the changes that occurred in each version. Semantic Versioning follows the X.Y.Z format, where X is the major version number, Y is the minor version number, and Z is the patch version number. Each number must be incremented when there are significant changes in the software, following some criteria defined by Semantic Versioning

## Conventional Commits
Conventional Commits is a specification for writing commit messages that follow a consistent and structured format. The goal is to facilitate the creation of changelogs, automatic versioning, and communication of changes to team members and stakeholders. Conventional Commits use a simple syntax that consists of a type, an optional scope, a colon, a space, and a description. The type indicates the kind of change that the commit introduces, such as feat, fix, refactor, etc. The scope can be used to specify the part of the codebase that is affected by the change. The description should be concise and imperative. Conventional Commits can also include optional body and footer sections for more details or reference
